Project: Sentence Similarity Checker
This project is a web-based application built with Streamlit that computes the semantic similarity between a source sentence and multiple comparison sentences using a pre-trained Sentence Transformers model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

Features:
User-Friendly Interface: Input fields for sentences and real-time similarity results.
Semantic Analysis: Displays similarity scores as percentages for easy interpretation.
Interactive Design: Includes progress bars for a visual representation of similarity.
